Explanation:

Replace /path/to/your/app with the actual path to your application directory. This is where the code resides that needs to be tested and deployed.

The run_tests function is where you should place the commands to run your application's tests.

The build_app function is where you should place the commands to build your application.

The deploy_to_staging function is where you should place the commands to deploy your application to the staging environment.

The main script checks if the current branch is the main branch. If it's not, the CI/CD pipeline will be skipped since it's assumed that feature branches don't require deployment.

If the tests run successfully ($? -eq 0), the application is built and deployed to the staging environment.
