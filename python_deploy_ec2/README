Make sure you have the boto3 library installed (pip install boto3) and AWS credentials configured properly 
(either in your environment variables or using AWS CLI configuration).

The script uses the boto3 library to interact with AWS services.
The create_ec2_instance function creates an EC2 instance using the specified image ID, 
instance type, and key name. It waits until the instance is in the "running" state 
and then prints the instance ID and public IP address.
The deploy_web_server function connects to the EC2 instance using SSH and installs 
Apache web server. It also creates a simple HTML page with the text 
"Hello from DevOps Automation!" and serves it using Apache.
In the __main__ section, the script specifies the AWS EC2 parameters such as 
image ID, instance type, key name, user, and key path. It then creates an EC2 instance and deploys a web server on it.
